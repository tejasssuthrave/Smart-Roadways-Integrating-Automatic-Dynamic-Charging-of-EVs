# Smart-Roadways-Integrating-Automatic-Dynamic-Charging-of-EVs
## Project Overview

**Smart Roadways: Integrating Automatic Dynamic Charging of EVs** is an innovative project focused on developing infrastructure that enables electric vehicles (EVs) to charge dynamically while in motion. This project aims to promote sustainable transportation by extending EV range, reducing dependency on stationary charging stations, and enhancing overall efficiency for electric vehicle users.

## Features

- **Dynamic Wireless Charging**: Vehicles can charge while driving over specially designed roadways equipped with wireless charging technology.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates with existing EV infrastructure and supports various types of electric vehicles.
- **Energy Optimization**: Minimizes energy loss and optimizes charging efficiency to support longer journeys.
- **Smart Traffic Management**: Includes smart traffic management features that enhance road safety and charging zone utilization.

## Technologies Used

- **IoT Integration**: To track vehicle position and manage charging zones dynamically.
- **EV Infrastructure**: Integration with EV charging systems to demonstrate real-world applicability.

- The system consists of a wireless power transmitter unit and a receiver unit embedded in vehicles. The transmitter unit includes a high-frequency inverter and transmitting coil that wirelessly transfers energy to the vehicle's receiving coil. The energy is then processed through a rectifier and filtering capacitor to charge the vehicle's battery or power its motor. This project focuses on enabling continuous, dynamic charging while the vehicle is in motion, promoting seamless and efficient energy transfer without the need for stationary charging stations.
